# UPLEARN
UPLEARN, the University of Toronto's Practice- and Community-Based LEarning And Research Network, is a "living laboratory" dedicated to clinical studies and health services research in family medicine that will enhance the primary care experience for both patients and providers, optimize the use of resources, and improve health for all.

UPLEARN is led by the Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Toronto, and is part of the Ontario-wide Primary Care Ontario Practice-based Learning And Research Network (POPLAR), a “network of networks” from six university Departments of Family Medicine and the Alliance for Healthier Communities in Ontario.

## Our mission
As the backbone of the health system, family doctors and other primary care providers are embedded in their communities. Leveraging this connection, UPLEARN’s mission is to contribute to a Learning Health System by engaging patients, care providers, administrators, and policymakers in prioritizing research questions, supporting DFCM faculty to engage in research, and translating research findings into tangible changes in policy and care.
